After implementing multiple terminals, OS just had a black screen and wouldn’t start/display shells
Fix : Update video memory to be current terminal’s video buffer on every RTC interrupt


When typing in initial terminal, keyboard inputs were displaying on active terminal from scheduler rather than displayed terminal
Fix : Changed keyboard driver so it only uses putc on shown terminal 


General Protection Fault when trying to execute literally any program (ls will print and then crash HARD) 
Fix : We were scheduling tasks that had children, so we stopped that and only cycled through “leaf” tasks


OS Crashes upon attempting to exit base shells
Fix : restart base shell instead of attempting to return to parent process (because there is no parent process)


Program terminated abnormally for like all programs
Fix : push retval after changing esp but before changing ebp in halt function


GREP just would not work, it wouldn’t find the command “grep”
Fix : Overwrote buffer for file read because previous buffer values clobbered new opens like with grep


LS Stopped worked after grep fixed
Fix : implemented boundary check on buf overwrite in file_read and dir_read
